•	I worked on 2 projects during this internship. Firstly, a Minor Project titled “Predicting Startup Profitability using Multi-Linear Regression Analysis: A Case Study of 50 Startups”.
•	This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information on 50 startups and predict their profitability using multi-linear regression analysis. By utilizing numerical input parameters such as R&D spending, administration spending, marketing spending, and state location, the project seeks to build a regression model that can estimate the profit of each startup.
•	Secondly, Major Project titled "Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews Using Support Vector Classifier (SVM) and Count Vectorizer"
•	This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of restaurant reviews using machine learning techniques. Specifically, the project utilizes Support Vector Classifier (SVM) in conjunction with Count Vectorizer to predict the sentiment label (positive or negative) of each review. By analyzing the subjective information expressed in the reviews, the model aims to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral, thereby providing insights into customer opinions and attitudes towards the restaurants.
